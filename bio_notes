    Cell: The smallest unit of the human body that keeps us all alive.
    DNA: One of the smallest bits (molecules) that are part of the genetic material of every cell of every organism, plant, animal or human.
    Chromosome: A lot of DNA combined together in the form of a chain is a chromosome. Humans have 46 chromosomes, Bacteria have 1. Each chromosome has something unique to the human. Each chromosome has DNA, the entire genome is spread around all the chromosomes.
    Gene: Smaller areas within a chromosome that contain chracteristics specific to that organism(loosely used) are genes.
    Genome: A set of all genes of that organism is a genome. Each cell in your body has a complete copy of your genome.

DNA Replication: 
    -If cells cant replicate, you're dead. So they need to always replicate, all the time.
    -Cells divide, as a means of reproduction and thus provide functionality to the body's various parts.For example: If a cell in your pancreas divided, the new cell would help the pancreas work just like the old cell did. How the cell works is decided by its DNA.
    -And hence, logically it makes sense that the DNA in cell 1 needs to get copied to the DNA in cell 2, else cell 2 would not know how to do its thing.
    -Every cell in our body has a nucleus. When the cell divides the nucleus of each cell has a chromosome. If eventually 10 copies of the first cell are made, all 
10 cells will have the same DNA in it.

Finding the Origin of Replication (ORI):
    -To understand more about replication we need to know how cells replicate. Hard in humans. Easier (but not trivial) in bacteria.
    -Human genome is a string with a defined start and end. Bacterial genome is circular, so there's no end - replication could start anywhere.
    -A protein called DNAa goes to the cell and triggers the release of an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This is what tells a cell to replicate. And somehow it finds the exact place where it starts this process. This means that there is something inside every string (DNAa box) that identifies the starting point. DNAa goes to each of these places (ORIs) and attaches itself there.
    -Its hard to identify this. However certain patterns repeat themselves in a genome (straight or circular), so if we can find these patterns, any of those could be the ORI.
    -So, if we want to identify the ORI, THIS is the problem statement. Find all strings of a pattern X in a string. The pattern that repeats most is the ORI.

Why do we need to find ORI?
    -Genetic manipulation of organisms/humans. Injecting a gene into an ill person to treat a disease or defend crops against a pesticide. If you don't know where
     ORI is, you could inject your changes and destroy ORI in that human and infect them even more than they currently are.
    -Biologically, scientists would just keep shortening the string and when replication no longer occurs, they know they're close to ORI. This can be done much faster using computers.

Recognizing ORI:
    - kmer: A string of length k
    - If you find lots of repeating kmers in a genome where k=9, then the one that repeats the most (including its complement (A,T), (C,G)) is most likely the ORI
    - If these kmers and/or their complements appear in clumps, meaning next to each other it further confirms that this is the hidden message that will cause DNAa
to start replication. DNAa then triggers release of DNA polymerase as before and replication actually starts.
    - There's no way though to say that finding clumps in 1 bacteria means that you will find these clumps in every genome of every bacteria. You'd have to test yourcode across the genomes of a number of bacteria.
    - Infact if you search for the those ORIs in the Thermotoga petrophila genome, it isn't found. This shows that there's no need for ORIs to be found in multiple
bacterial genomes.
    - Looks like the best way is to search for 9mers in a genome, find its complement and then see how many times both occur in the genome overall. The more times they appear, the greater the likelihood of it being the ORI for that genome. Once you find the ORI, you can try and do something to it to prevent it from replicating.

How does DNA replicate? (Meselson Stahl experiment)
    The parent had N15. Then it replicated using one of the 3 means (Conservative, Semi or Diverse). At this point I had a question though. Where does the daughter strand pick up its nitrogen from? The parent? Or the environment? If its the parent, the daughter will keep getting N15 all the time until it is exhausted and then there would be no more replication. But this is not true, since as long as the organism is alive, replication keeps happening.

    That means the replication is from the environment. The parent originally had N15. If then:
    - Semi-conservative: The daughter would have 1 strand N14 and 1 strand (from parent) as N15
    - Conservative: The daughter would have both strands as N14
    - Diverse: The daughter would have a mix of N14 and N15

    By looking at how replication happened once the EColi was put into N14, they'd be able to find how replication happened - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RQfSdTrIIk. Apparently, you can separate newly created strands using a centrifuge and find their density out (genes_per_basepair) whatever that means.

Direction:
    - A sugar molecule has 5 carbon atoms. It is attached at its 5 carbon atom to the phosphate and then to hydroxyl group at its 3 end. (NOT CLEAR). When reading a DNA strand though, read it 5 to 3.

Detailed DNA replication:
    - Double helix. Semi conservative. Daughter strand has 1 parent strand and 1 of their own strands.
    - Enzyme generated. DNA forms a replication fork. Then RNA attaches a primer at ORI to leading and lagging strands. DNA polymerase attaches itself to the primer.
    - Replication starts from 5end towards 3end on both strands. Direction is opposite in both though since 5end is at opposite ends in the leading and the
      lagging strand.
    - However this takes care of only half of the strands, in both leading and lagging.
    - Also remember that this process is completely asymmetric
    - The remaining half is handled differently. Once replication starts in 1 direction, a small part of the strand that remains, is replicated (Okazaki fragments).
      This is the forward strand that cannot replicate on its own and has to wait as the reverse strand works. Multiple such primers (DNA Polymerase) attach themselves to the forward strands and replicate the forward strand bit by bit. This happens on both strands.
    - Only 1 primer is needed for the reverse strand, but multiple primers are needed for the forward strand.
    - Eventually DNA Ligase is generated, joins everything in the daughter and you have a new replicated genome in a new cell.
    - Look at the Youtube video - DNA replication - 3D.mp3. It is very good.
    ** NOTE: A forward parent half-strand synthesizes a reverse daughter half-strand **

More details about the 2 halves of a DNA strand
    - The reverse strand quickly replicates so its almost always double stranded, unlike the forward strand which is single stranded.
    - Single stranded = more mutation. C changes to T. And so on. Meaning some funny combinations are formed and some nucleotides are more or less on the forward strands. Hence since lots of C becomes T, there's less C on the forward strand.
    - C_reverse > C_Forward, G_reverse < G_forward, A & T similar on both strands
    - Use this to split the genome into chunks of 500 nucleotides at a time and find the chunk that has the least C. This'll mean we've found the forward strand and hence ORI lies somewhere really nearby. Plot a graph of number of C's vs position
    - More accurate way is to track G-C on both strands. On the reverse strand G-C will decrease, on the forward G-C will increase. The transition point is ORI.
    - Plot a graph of the values of (G-C) vs position. This is a "skew array" graph and it'll look very similar to the window graph that we plotted earlier, just that it is more accurate
    - The place where G-C is the smallest is the approximate location of ori
    - Now you identify all 9mers in and around that window along with its reverse complements. This is so you can find the actual DNAa box (exact pattern) that triggers the replication. Even if there's slight differences (1 nucleotide) in patterns, that's fine, it could still be the correct pattern since imperfect matches are alsopossible.
    - Sometimes you can find lots of kmers that all have multiple matches and any of these could be ORIs. But this is still better than the brute force approach that biologists would have to perform without if they did not have programs to help them identify at least a set of ORIs. At this point biologists can go back to hte brute force approach of cutting off the genome at each of the set of the ORIs that the programmers identified.
